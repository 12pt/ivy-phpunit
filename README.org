* ivy-phpunit

Quick-select your PHP functions in your PHPUnit test classes. Currently it's basically an ivy-clone of helm-phpunit, but more functionality will be added.

** Usage

Bind =ivy-phpunit-select-test= to a keybinding and then call from within your test class. Select a method to pass to PHPUnit and presto - your test will be run.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'php-mode-hook (lambda ()
                           (local-set-key (kbd "C-x t") 'ivy-phpunit-select-test)))
#+END_SRC

** Customize

Currently you can select or deselect test functions to not be listed in the prompt - default is to not list =setUp= and =tearDown=.

Changing this outside of =M-x customize= is as simple as:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq ivy-phpunit-ignorelist '("myIgnoredFunction"))
#+END_SRC

Obviously to ignore nothing, pass an empty list.
